# Personal Portfolio

This is the project you are currently looking at! It is a high-performance personal website designed to showcase my work and thoughts.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Content**: MDX (Markdown + JSX)
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Netlify

## Key Features

1.  **Fast by default**: Astro ships zero JavaScript to the client by default.
2.  **Dark Mode**: Fully supported using Tailwind's `dark` variant.
3.  **Responsive**: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
4.  **Math Support**: Renders mathematical formulas using KaTeX.

## Future Plans

- Add a search functionality.
- Integrate a comment system.
- Add more animations using Framer Motion (or similar).
